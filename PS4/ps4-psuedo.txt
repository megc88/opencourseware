Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:
Problem 2a:
-Take in a text string
-Check to see if all words are valid words, if so, return
-Initialize a variable for your guess of the shift amount at 1, guess_shift. 
-Initialize a variable for total number of valid words at 0, valid_words
-Initialize a variable for the shift key at 1, shift
-Run the text through an decoder using your shift_guess. Test shift_guess 1 to 27:
while shift_guess < 27
-split the string into words to be able to check how many valid words
-for word in text
	if
		result > valid_words
		valid words = result
		shift = guess_shift
		shift += 1
	else
		shift +=1
-return shift set to the shift_guess that returns the most valid words
